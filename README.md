# Spaceship Game in 2D
  This game was made in C# + Unity for an internship selection process of Studio Sol (Brazilian Company).

# Overview
  This 2-player game has as the main goal eliminate the opponent. The players can fire, move in all directions and brake. Each spaceship has a life bar (the green color indicates the remaining life). It's importante to emphasize that the Blue Spaceship moves faster than the Red Spaceship but fire the missiles slower. Besides that, there is a Black Hole in the center of the scene that influences in the movement of the players (this component produces a force of attraction in the players).
